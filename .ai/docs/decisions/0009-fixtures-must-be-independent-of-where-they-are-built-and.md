# Fixtures must be independent of where they are built, and that is checked

Two separate leaks put the build location into a committed fixture and cost two red CI runs:
`.gitmodules` recorded an absolute submodule url, which changed the superproject's tree and therefore
every commit hash recorded in the worktree listing; and git reports worktree paths with symlinks
resolved, so on macOS an output directory under `/var` came back as `/private/var` and escaped the
path rewrite.

`make verify-generated` now regenerates a second time from a differently-named directory and diffs
the result. Two runs in the same directory cannot catch this class of bug, which is exactly why it
reached CI twice — and the new check is what found the symlink case, rather than a third red run.

The worktree listing is the only golden file that is edited on the way out: its root is rewritten to
a fixed token, because absolute paths are inherent to that command's output. The record layout, which
is the thing being asserted, stays byte-for-byte as git emitted it.
